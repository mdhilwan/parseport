## Passport to Visa

The project produces 2 screen: desktop webapp and mobile webapp

### App

You can drag and drop your passport photo and it would scan the passport details and present it on a table.
The table is editable just incase the scans are not accurate.
You can then download the Visa paperwork generated.
Or you can download the table as excel sheet to be used.
It also provides a QR code where you can scan with your phone. This will link the phone with the desktop webapp.
Now you can use your phone as a scanner to scan passports.
The scanned details will appear in the linked desktop in the same table.
